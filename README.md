## Introduction

This repository contains web development projects that demonstrate various skills, ranging from static websites to full-stack applications. It is intended to serve as a portfolio of my work, including examples of responsive design, API integration, server-side logic, and database management.

### Key Folders and Files

- **REST/**: Contains the REST API server and related files.
  - `views/`: EJS templates for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
  - `public/`: Static files like CSS and JavaScript.
  - `index.js`: Main server file for handling REST API routes.

- **SQL/**: Contains SQL-related files and database logic.
  - `index.js`: Server logic for interacting with the SQL database.
  - `queries.sql`: SQL scripts for database setup and queries.

- **node_modules/**: Auto-generated folder for Node.js dependencies.

- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

Feel free to update this structure as your project evolves!# Web Development Portfolio
