In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Here's how you use each of them:

1. **Using `var`** (older syntax, function-scoped):
   ```javascript
   var name = "John";
   var age = 30;
   ```

2. **Using `let`** (block-scoped, preferred for mutable variables):
   ```javascript
   let city = "New York";
   let score = 100;
   ```

3. **Using `const`** (block-scoped, for constants that shouldn't change):
   ```javascript
   const country = "India";
   const PI = 3.14159;
   ```

- Use `var` sparingly as `let` and `const` offer better scoping and reduce potential bugs.
- `const` is used when you don't want the variable value to change.
